# **📚 Bookstack**

**Bookstack** is a unified, e-reader-friendly web interface designed to bridge the gap between book discovery, library management, and device delivery. By combining the power of **Booklore** and **Shelfmark**, Bookstack allows you to manage your entire reading workflow—from requesting a new title to sending it to your Kindle—all from your e-reader's built-in browser.

## **✨ Key Features**

* **OPDS Integration:** Suitable for older browsers (Kindle, Kobo)
* **E-Reader Optimized:** A lightweight web interface specifically designed for the lower refresh rates and constraints of e-ink browsers.  
* **Universal Search:** Leveraging **Shelfmark's Universal Search**, queries are resolved against multiple metadata providers (like Google Books, OpenLibrary) to ensure high-quality results.
* **Release Selection:** View and select specific releases from your configured Prowlarr indexers. Choose the exact file, format, and size you want.
* **One-Click "Send to Kindle":** Configure your Kindle delivery address once and trigger wireless transfers directly from your library.  
* **Request Monitoring:** Track the real-time status of your Shelfmark requests, complete with detailed error messages if downloads fail.
* **Booklore Library Browser:** A clean, searchable view of your existing Booklore collection.
* **View all an author's books, in series order, with flags for what is and isn't in your library:** Making download management simple.
* **Request > Download > Add to Booklore > Send to Kindle** All from your device browser, no need for other solutions or jailbreaking devices

## **🚀 How It Works**

Bookstack acts as the "connective tissue" for your self-hosted book stack:

1. **Search:** Use the integrated search to find a title. Metadata is fetched instantly.
2. **Select:** Click "View Releases" to see available files from Prowlarr/Indexers. Select the best release for you.
3. **Track:** Monitor the download status on your dashboard queue.
4. **Deliver:** Once the book is added to your **Booklore** library, click the "Send to Kindle" button to deliver it wirelessly.

## **⚡ Quick Start**

The fastest way to get Bookstack running alongside your existing services is via Docker. Ensure you have **Booklore** and **Shelfmark** running.

Use the compose.yaml file and modify the example .env file to suit your needs.

Initially set up to install Booklore (Library Management), Shelfmark (Downloader), Prowlarr (Download manager using Usenet - optional), and Bookstack (E-Reader web interface) as a full stack solution, but adapt this for personal requirements.
Compose is configured to use Traefik on a VPS, but adapt this to whatever your network dictates.

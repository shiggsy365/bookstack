# **📚 Bookstack**

**Bookstack** is a unified, e-reader-friendly web interface designed to bridge the gap between book discovery, library management, and device delivery. By combining the power of **Booklore** and **Ephemera**, Bookstack allows you to manage your entire reading workflow—from requesting a new title to sending it to your Kindle—all from your e-reader's built-in browser.

## **✨ Key Features**

* **E-Reader Optimized:** A lightweight web interface specifically designed for the lower refresh rates and constraints of e-ink browsers.  
* **One-Click "Send to Kindle":** Configure your Kindle delivery address once and trigger wireless transfers directly from your library.  
* **Ephemera Integration:** Search for and request new books via Ephemera without leaving the Bookstack interface.  
* **Request Monitoring:** Track the real-time status of your Ephemera requests so you know exactly when they are ready for delivery.  
* **Booklore Library Browser:** A clean, searchable view of your existing Booklore collection.

## **🚀 How It Works**

Bookstack acts as the "connective tissue" for your self-hosted book stack:

1. **Search & Request:** Use the integrated **Ephemera** search to find a title you want.  
2. **Track:** Monitor the download/processing status on your dashboard.  
3. **Deliver:** Once the book is added to your **Booklore** library, click the "Send to Kindle" button to deliver it wirelessly.

## **⚡ Quick Start**

The fastest way to get Bookstack running alongside your existing services is via Docker.


## **🛠️ Configuration**

3. Scroll down to **Approved Personal Document E-mail List**.  
4. Add the SMTP\_USER email address you configured above to the list of approved senders.
